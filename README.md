# Logistics Performance Analysis
An in-depth analysis of shipment completion, delivery efficiency, customer satisfaction, and regional performance for a leading logistics company. This project uses five years of operational data to uncover insights, identify bottlenecks, and recommend improvements across transport modes and delivery regions.

## Project Overview
This report provides an in-depth analysis of logistics data, focusing on shipment completion rates, in-progress shipments, shipment values, and delivery times. It is designed to track the performance of completed shipments, the status of in-progress shipments, and insights into customer satisfaction, carrier performance, and delivery metrics across different regions.
The report is split into three key sections:
1.	Overview and Shipment Trends
2.	Shipment Forecasting by Shipping Mode (Jet, Bus, Lorry, Motorbike)
3.	Customer Experience and Delivery Metrics

## Problem Statement
Despite the growing demand for logistics services between 2020 and 2024, the company has experienced increasing difficulty in maintaining delivery efficiency, ensuring consistent customer satisfaction, and optimizing shipment performance across various transport modes and regions. Shipment completion rates have been inconsistent, particularly for high-priority deliveries. Transport types such as Motorbikes and Lorries frequently underperform, with recurring delays and customer complaints. Additionally, regions like Port Harcourt have shown prolonged delivery times and lower satisfaction scores compared to others.
These inefficiencies not only affect operational reliability but also hinder the company’s ability to deliver value to its customers and manage costs effectively. Without a clear understanding of the root causes, whether they stem from mode-specific bottlenecks, poor carrier performance, regional infrastructure gaps, or misaligned resource allocation, the company risks reduced customer retention, increased delivery costs, and missed revenue opportunities.
A data-driven diagnostic and prescriptive approach is needed to uncover performance gaps and empower executives with insights to optimize delivery routes, carrier selection, and service quality.

## Goal and Objective of the Analysis:
Goal:
The primary goal of this analysis is to provide insights into the logistics performance, identify any inefficiencies, and provide actionable recommendations to optimize shipment completion and in-progress shipments. The report aims to help stakeholders understand the trends, value, and customer satisfaction levels related to the delivery process, as well as the impact of different delivery modes, to determine whether shipments arrived as and when due or not.
Objectives:
1.	Measure the completed shipments by various transport modes and track their trends over months and years.
2.	Analyze the value of shipments, including any fluctuations in shipment value over time and by transport mode.
3.	Break down shipment performance by region, particularly tracking expected shipments in each city for each transport mode.
4.	Assess customer satisfaction based on shipment performance, delivery time, and feedback on different shipment types.
5.	Highlight areas where improvements can be made in logistics efficiency, such as reducing delivery time or improving customer satisfaction.
