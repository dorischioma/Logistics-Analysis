# Logistics-Analysis

## Project Overview: 
A leading logistics company is currently facing challenges in maintaining delivery efficiency, ensuring customer satisfaction, and optimizing shipment performance across different transport modes and regions. Despite growing demand, the organization has observed inconsistencies in shipment completion rates, delays in high-priority deliveries, and varied levels of customer feedback, particularly tied to certain modes of transport such as Motorbikes and Lorries. Regional disparities in delivery times and shipment value have also raised concerns about route planning and carrier performance.

The goal of this project is to deliver a holistic view of the companyâ€™s logistics performance by leveraging key performance indicators such as delivery time, shipment value, and shipment status. The analysis will aim to reveal underlying trends and performance fluctuations across different transport modes and regions, helping to pinpoint areas of strength and those requiring improvement. Ultimately, the project seeks to provide actionable insights that will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions, enhance operational efficiency, streamline delivery processes, and improve overall customer satisfaction.
